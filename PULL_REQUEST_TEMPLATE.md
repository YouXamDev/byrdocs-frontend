# Pull Request: Bug Fixes and Improvements

## 📋 Summary
This PR addresses multiple critical issues found during code review of the byrdocs-frontend project, including ESLint compatibility, security vulnerabilities, bundle optimization, and type safety improvements.

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. ESLint Configuration Compatibility
- **Problem**: ESLint 9.x incompatibility with old `.eslintrc.cjs` format
- **Solution**: Migrated to flat config format with proper globals and rules
- **Impact**: ESLint now works correctly with latest version

### 2. Security Vulnerabilities
- **Problem**: 2 low-severity vulnerabilities in `brace-expansion` package
- **Solution**: Updated all dependencies to latest versions
- **Impact**: All security vulnerabilities resolved

### 3. Bundle Size Optimization
- **Problem**: Main chunk size was >500kB causing performance warnings
- **Solution**: Implemented manual code splitting in Vite config
- **Impact**: Main bundle reduced from ~548kB to ~360kB with better distribution

### 4. Type Safety Issues
- **Problem**: Potential runtime errors from unsafe type assumptions
- **Solution**: Added proper null checking and generic type constraints
- **Impact**: Improved development experience and runtime safety

### 5. Naming Conflicts
- **Problem**: TypeScript redeclaration error in sidebar component
- **Solution**: Renamed conflicting interface to avoid collision
- **Impact**: Clean TypeScript compilation without errors
